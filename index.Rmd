We are sure R and Python are cheap.

# About R vs. Python ...

+ [Python is the second best language for everything.]( https://sixfeetup.com/blog/4-reasons-to-choose-python)
+ They both do .red[any analysis] you can think of.
+ They both support .red[reproducible research].
+ The R community is .red[friendly], patient, and community focused.
    + Posit (formerly R Studio) is a [B corp](https://www.bcorporation.net/en-us/).
  + https://www.datatrail.org/
+ Based on our experience, R is faster to .red[set up and learn] if you are starting from zero.
+ [R is the second most referenced language behind SPSS, which was released in 1968.](https://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)

# By the Numbers
+ .red[Free] to consortium members (slightly limited by international export controls)
+ Wildly .red[popular]  
  + 6,000+ institutions in more than 150 countries
  + Acknowledged in more than 23,000 articles

# IDEA Syringe Services Program

+ The Infectious Disease Elimination Act (IDEA) of 2016 was signed into law on July 1, 2016.
+ This policy authorized the University of Miami to open the .red[first] legal syringe services program (or .red[needle exchange]) in the state of .red[Florida]
    + decriminalized possession and distribution of syringes for those engaged in the program
    + 5-year, unfunded pilot project, set to end in July, 2021

+ Prior to implementation, REDCap was used to build a data collection system to evaluate the pilot program with the sole purpose of .red[providing data to the legislature] to enhance advocacy efforts for statewide expansion of the program.

REDCap Processing with `tidyREDCap`

---
# What .blue[`tidyREDCap`] Does

1. Easy imports into R from REDCap
  + [import_instruments()](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/articles/import_instruments.html0) imports all data with labels (i.e., the text that appears on the survey page).
2. Summarizes categorical variables
  + [make_choose_one_table()](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/articles/makeChooseOneTable.html) makes a summary of a choose-one question.
  + [make_choose_all_table()](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/articles/makeChooseAllTable.html) shows counts of all the options chosen from choose-all questions.
  + [make_binary_word()](https://raymondbalise.github.io/tidyREDCap/reference/make_binary_word.html) shows response patterns from choose-all questions.

# Import Everything with .blue[`tidyREDCap::import_instruments()`]

+ .blue[`tidyREDCap`] allows you to pull in all the instruments by adding a .blue[`tidyREDCap::import_instruments()`] call.  All you need is the .red[URL] for your copy of REDCap and your .red[API] token.
+ .red[Do not save your API token in your code.]  It is way too easy to accidentally give away your password.
+ There are good options to securely store your API keys.  If you work on an secure/encrypted machine, a fair alternative is to store your API keys in your *R environment* file. I use: .blue[`usethis::edit_r_environ()`]
    
---
# Store Your API Token

+ Copy the token (password text) from REDCap.

.center[
![:scale 50%](images/02_examples/idea_token.jpg)
]

+ Open your R environment file with .blue[`usethis::edit_r_environ()`] and give your token a meaningful name. Use an `=` and quote the string.
.center[
![:scale 50%](images/02_examples/idea_r_environ.jpg)
]

---
# Add Code to Load

+ Typically you would just do:

```{r eval=FALSE}
tidyREDCap::import_instruments(
  "https://redcap.miami.edu/api/", 
  Sys.getenv("nacho_anxiety_key") 
)
```

+ Because this project uses a custom subject ID name and numbering, do:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# run me once
tidyREDCap::import_instruments(
  url = "https://redcapdemo.vanderbilt.edu/api/", 
  token = Sys.getenv("fake_idea_data_cpdd"), 
  record_id= "id_code", first_record_id = "07"
)
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# run me once
library(readr)
write_rds(daily, "./data/daily.rds")
write_rds(enrollment, "./data/enrollment.rds")
```

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
daily <- read_rds("./data/daily.rds")
enrollment <- read_rds("./data/enrollment.rds")
```


---
# Loaded Data


.center[
![:scale 50%](images/02_examples/idea_environment.jpg)

# The Origin of .blue[`tidyREDCap`]

+ Novices could not process the export of choose-all-that-apply questions.
  + For example, the export has a column for Carfentanil, Cocaine, Crack, etc.
+ How do we get the count of all the chosen things?
+ How can we look at co-occurring patterns?

# Substance Use Pattern "Words"

+ We summarize a participant's use of a class of substances for a single week in the trial protocol via the following "letters":
  - .red[**+**]: positive for the substance(s) by urine screen (or participant self-report/TLFB, if such data are of interest) at a specific visit or in a specified window of time (a day, week, etc.) 
  - .red[**–**]: negative for the substance(s) 
  - .red[**o**]: patient failed to provide a urine sample
  - .red[<b>\*</b>]: inconclusive results or mixed results (e.g., patient provided more than one urine sample in the time interval and the results did not agree)
  - .red[<b>\_</b>]: no specimens required per study design (weekends, holidays, pre-randomization period, alternating visit days/weeks, clinic excused visits)
+ For subject 2, their .red[opioid use pattern] during treatment is: .red[`+----oo-o-o-o+o`]

<!-- For the en dash above, I had to copy and paste it from the internet. The double dash wasn't rendering as an en dash anymore. -->


---
# Properties of "Words"

Because these patterns are being used to replace aspects of patient medical charts in analysis, they must have the following properties:

1. (*Machine-Readable*) It can be directly parsed by a .red[computer].
2. (*Human-Readable*) It can be quickly and easily interpreted by a .red[human].
3. (*Sufficient*) It represents .red[all of the same information] about the [univariate] sequence of interest that would be present in the full data.

+ When you decided who "succeeded" and who "failed", did you look at:
  - End-of-study .red[strict abstinence]?
  - .red[Not relapsing] while in treatment?
  - .red[Longest time] of abstinence?
  - Treatment .red[retention]?
  - Greatest .red[proportion] of negative UDS?
+ .red[Does a missed visit imply substance use?]

# Defining Treatment Endpoints in Code

+ Prof. Laura Brandt spent two years cataloging every opioid use disorder clinical trial outcome used between 1970 and 2020.
+ We partnered with Brandt to create a library of computer code in the R language to explicitly define and calculate each of these outcomes given a patient-specific use pattern "word".
+ The code libraries are published here:
    - [Abstinence outcomes](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_abstinence_20220711.html)
    - [Relapse outcomes](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_relapse_20220711.html)
    - [Use Reduction outcomes](https://ctn-0094.github.io/CTNote/articles/library_reduction_20220630.html)

# Example Outcome Code and Output

This is a measure of opioid use reduction (where smaller numbers are better).

**Discuss:**

+ Is patient 2089 really doing worse than patient 0013?
+ If "end of treatment abstinence" were used, would patient 0004 still be a success?

# Tools We Learned About

+ .red[REDCap] can help you collect structured data; we recommend using REDCap well to prevent "garbage in: garbage out" in your analyses.
+ The R package .blue[`rUM`] (available on CRAN) can set up a research project directory complete with a manuscript shell on your computer and is a valuable tool to help teach new researchers how to organize files for a reproducible manuscript.
+ .blue[Quarto] is the next generation of literate programming and reproducible scientific manuscript preparation. It comes packaged with the newest release of RStudio (or available as a stand-alone).
+ The R packages .blue[public.ctn0094data], .blue[public.ctn0094extra], .blue[DOPE], and .blue[CTNote] can be helpful to a) show examples of clinical trials data, b) clean interview notes and other free-text fields where drugs are discussed, and c) summarize long-form UDS/Timeline Followback data and calculate endpoints from these summaries.
